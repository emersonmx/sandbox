# stm

This is just a tool I use to install my stuff. The current version is at
[https://github.com/emersonmx/stm](https://github.com/emersonmx/stm),
but i put it here, this tool is a toy.

## Instalação

```sh
go install
```

## Uso

```sh
# Show available managers
stm list

# Install packages from a manager
stm install <manager>

# Update a manager's packages
stm update <manager>
```

## Conclusão

As interesting as programming in Go is, it's still pretty weird. There
were times when it hurt not to have a `filter()` or `map()` in my life. I
can not think where I could use this language.
