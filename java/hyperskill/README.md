# Hyperskill

Location where I keep versions of Hyperskill projects.

For each project I usually put some restrictions to try to simulate the
condition that I still don't have knowledge of a certain subject. And also
to make it more fun 😁

PS: When possible I try to simplify the project to just one file, as it is
easier to execute.
