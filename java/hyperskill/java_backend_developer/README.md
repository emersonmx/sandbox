# Java Backend Developer

Now that it started to heat up! Now that I've released another 10% of my
power I have more freedom to do whatever I want! HAHAHAHA 😈

As this track has more "advanced" content, I can do almost anything I want.
However, I can still only use the content available on the track. It's fun
to program with constraints 😁
